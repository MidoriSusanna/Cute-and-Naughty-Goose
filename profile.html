            <h1>If your score is less than 6:<br>
                Today you feel like a naughty goose!</h1>
                <p>Today might not be your best day; you are feeling as mischievous as a playful goose. The day's minor inconveniences annoy you, pushing you to seek distractions from the usual routine. Occasionally, breaking free from the norm can be invigorating, but tread carefully, as you do not want to inadvertently hurt your beloved animal companions. <br><br>
                    <b>Chameleon Home: Finding Harmony</b>  <br>
                    Living with a chameleon housemate who creates messes and hides away can be challenging. However, try to extend understanding and patience, for perhaps, the chameleon is merely shy. Invest some time in tidying up and transforming your space into a comfortable haven.  <br><br>
                    <b>Froggy Friendships: True Connections</b>  <br>
                    Reflect deeply on the authenticity of your friendships. Sometimes, it's natural to question the sincerity of those around us. However, when a frog and a goose can form a genuine bond, you can be sure it's a union built on true love!  <br><br>
                    <b>Armadillo's Admirations: Embrace Self-Confidence</b>  <br>
                    You are undoubtedly fabulous, and you do not need to accept compliments to confirm it. While your self-confidence is admirable, remember not to dismiss those who hold affection for you.  <br><br>
                    <b>Nightly Escapades: Break from Routine</b>  <br>
                    The daily grind can be exhausting, especially during these moments when you yearn for the weekend to escape with your animal friends. Duty can seem dull, but even a simple day at the pond can be profoundly enjoyable. Take the time to unwind, and you will find life taking a delightful turn for the better.  <br></p>
