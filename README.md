<h1>Cute and Naughty Goose</h1>
<br>
<p>"Cute and Naughty Goose” falls somewhere between a game and an aptitude test; it offers an enjoyable experience and provides some valuable insights or food for thought for your day. <br>
Primarily designed for moments of leisure, this game is suitable for both adults and children. It's a game meant for moments to share with friends, allowing you to compare the kind of 'goose profile' you feel like on a given day. Beyond its playful and amusing side, it can also serve as a source of reflection and self-awareness for when you have a free moment, like during your daily commute from home to work. <br>
The game is intentionally designed to be brief to prevent users from losing interest and abandoning the page due to the length of the process. There are five comprehensive questions, each of substantial length, spanning the duration of a day in the life of the goose. <br>
The choice of the goose as the central character is partly due to its visual appeal and mischievous nature, making it a fitting choice. Inspiration for the game also draws from the animal world, akin to an Aesop's fable, where animals represent not just themselves but various human types and qualities. <br>
The guiding principle here is simple: fun. The game is instant and intuitively structured, with the aim of leaving a smile on the faces of those who play, without burdening them with complex questions or lengthy tests. <br></p>

<h1>Features </h1>
<p> The game comprises three distinct sections: an introductory page (index.html), the game or test (game.html), and a final page presenting two profiles of geese (profile.html). Each of these pages maintains a consistent header section with title and subtitle. <br>
On the introductory page (index.html), the game is succinctly explained, allowing the user to name their goose. Upon doing so, the game provides an introductory greeting. A "Start" button facilitates direct access to the main game. On all other pages, a dedicated button is always available for returning to the index.html start page. This feature enables players to easily restart the game without the need to use the browser's 'back' button. <br>
The game section (game.html) comprises a container where questions and answers are displayed, alongside a 'Next' button and a footer that showcases the score for each question. The score section, nearly identical on both the game.html and profile.html pages, consists of two icons and a score counter that increments based on the chosen answers. Additionally, within this section, there is a button allowing users to commence the game again from the home page. <br>
The page featuring the goose profiles (profile.html) has a score container just beneath the header, ensuring the final score is prominently visible to the user. It also has a section displaying two distinct goose profiles. Towards the end of the page, a button is provided for restarting the game, encouraging users to try again on the following day.<br></p>

<h2>Introduction and game explanation</h2>
<p> The game's explanation is contained within a central container on the page. Alongside this explanation, two functions are available: "Name your goose" and "Start”.<br>
"Name your goose" is a form where users can provide a name for the game's main character, the goose. This action results in an initial greeting generated through an event listener on the submit button, using also template literals. <br>
Once the goose is named, clicking the "Start" button will direct the user to the game.html page.<br></p>
